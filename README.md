# AngularRouting
I have created an index page whith contains three pages attached to it. I have used ng-routing directives and route params service to navigate through these pages internally and also implemented angular ajax to fetch two dummy restful apis inorder to show up a dummy profile that uses resolve to fetch dependencies before going to the template urls
